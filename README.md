## Description
### Precision
Precision is one indicator of a machine learning model's performance – the quality of a positive prediction made by the model. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives).
### Recall
Recall, also known as the true positive rate (TPR), is the percentage of data samples that a machine learning model correctly identifies as belonging to a class of interest—the “positive class”—out of the total samples for that class.
### F1 Score
F1 score is a machine learning evaluation metric that measures a model's accuracy. It combines the precision and recall scores of a model. The accuracy metric computes how many times a model made a correct prediction across the entire dataset.
